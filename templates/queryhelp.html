        <p>SourceControl.me's report system allows you to create custom data views relating to your repositories.
        Reports are created with a set of queries that you specify.</p>
        <p>These queries specify custom metrics to analyze. Visualizations that appear in your report are generated
        from your queries.. We use a language inspired by SQL for creating queries.</p>
        <p>The query language provides three basic commands: find, get, and count. Find queries retrieve either users,
        commits, or branches. Get queries extract information from those sources. Count queries simply count the number
        of results of a query.</p>
        <p>'Find' queries find information sources within a repository. The simplest find query is perhaps</p>
        <p class="queryhelp-paragraph">find users</p>
        <p>Which will simply return all users who have committed to the repository. This can be done with branches
        and commits as well. Queries can be augmented with parameters to gather only wanted results. For example, we can get
        users with large numbers of commits with</p>
        <p class="queryhelp-paragraph">find users where num_commits &gt; 10</p>
        <p>Additional conditions can be specified by appending them with commas in between.</p>
        <p>'Get' queries retrieve pertinent information from within repository information sources. For example, if
        we want to focus on the additions of users, we can get that specific piece of information from them with</p>
        <p class="queryhelp-paragraph">get additions from users</p>
        <p>These queries can also of course use filters. Finally, count queries simply return the number of results
        for a certain query. For example, to find the number of commits on a certain day we could use</p>
        <p class="queryhelp-paragraph">count commits where commit_time = "12-04-2014"</p>
